## Exam Format

There are three parts to the COMC to be completed in a total of 2 hours and 30 minutes:

### PART A

Four introductory questions worth 4 marks each. You do not have to show your work. A correct final answer gives full marks. However, if your final answer is incorrect and you have shown your work in the space provided, you might earn partial marks.

### PART B

Four more challenging questions worth 6 marks each. Marking and partial marks follow the same rule as part A.

### PART C

Four long-form proof problems worth 10 marks each. Complete work must be shown. Partial marks may be awarded.

#### Diagrams provided are not drawn to scale; they are intended as aids only.

### Scrap paper/extra pages

You may use scrap paper, but you have to throw it away when you finish your work and hand in your booklet. Only the work you do on the pages provided in the booklet will be evaluated for marking. Extra pages are not permitted to be inserted in your booklet.

### Exact solutions

It is expected that all calculations and answers will be expressed as exact numbers such as 4π, $$2+\sqrt{7}$$ , etc., rather than as 12.566, 4.646, etc.&#x20;

### Awards

The names of all award winners will be published on the Canadian Mathematical Society website.
